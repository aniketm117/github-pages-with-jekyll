Hello, I am Aniket. I started teaching Physics to class 11 and 12 students for engineering entrance exams (as well 
as Boards) in 2014 with FIITJEE, & I have worked with similar organizations like Vidya Mandir Classes, Aakash, Avanti Fellows-ALS since then.

Here is a [guide](https://aniketm117.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/2020/06/24/intro-to-kinematics.html) I created long ago for someone looking to start kinematics with a bit of vector technicalities.

Watching IPL right now ? I have also created an [app](https://aniketm117-regression-model-web-app-main-2lx3jl.streamlit.app/) to analyse IPL Player Auction data to make prediction of a player`s sold price.

Thanks for visiting!
