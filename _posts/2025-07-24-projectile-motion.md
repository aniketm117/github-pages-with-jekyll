### Projectile Motion

In a projectile motion of an object imparted a velocity (v), the key assumptions are:

- no air resistance to the motion of the object
- earth is flat
- acceleration due to gravity is uniform everywhere

Motion of the object along x and y direction are independent of each other. The important quantities in a projectile motion are R = Horizontal Range, H = Maximum Height above ground, and T = Time of flight.

For a particle projected with velocity 'v' and at an angle 'Î¸' with the horizontal.
