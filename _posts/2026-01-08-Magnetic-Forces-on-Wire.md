# Magnetic Forces on Current Carrying Wire


## 1. The Current

The current in a wire is the charge per unit time passing a given point. In practice, it is ordinarily the negatively
charged electrons that do the moving—in the direction opposite to the electric current.

 λ traveling down a wire at speed v constitutes a current
 
I = λv, 

because a segment of length vΔt, carrying charge λvΔt, passes point P in a time
interval Δt. Current is actually a vector:

I = λv. [Eq.1]

Because the path of the flow is dictated by the shape of the wire, one doesn’t ordinarily bother to display the direction of I explicitly, but when it comes to
surface and volume currents we cannot afford to be so casual, and for the sake of notational consistency it is a good idea to acknowledge the vectorial character of
currents right from the start. A neutral wire, of course, contains as many stationary positive charges as mobile negative ones. The former do not contribute to the
current—the charge density λ in Eq. 1 refers only to the moving charges. In the unusual situation where both types move, I = λ+v+ + λ−v−.

## 2. Magnetic Force on a current carrying wire

The magnetic force on a segment of current-carrying wire is

Fmag = ∫(v × B) dq = ∫(v × B)λ dl = ∫(I × B) dl.

Inasmuch as I and dl both point in the same direction, we can just as well write this as

Fmag = ∫I(dl × B).

Typically, the current is constant (in magnitude) along the wire, and in that case I
comes outside the integral:

Fmag = I∫(dl × B).
