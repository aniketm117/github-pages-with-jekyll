The time rate of work being done or energy transfer is defined as *Power*. 

Instantaneous Power delivered = dW/dt = F * v * cos Ө

W is the work done by force F, t is time instant, v is velocity of the particle and Ө is the angle between Force and velocity.

Average Power delivered in Δt time interval  = ΔW/Δt

Q.1 A body of mass m1 accelerates uniformly from rest to v1 in time t1, the instantaneous power delivered to the body as a function of time ‘t’ is 

(a) m* v<sub>1</sub>* t / t<sub>1</sub> (b) m * v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> * t / t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> (c) m * v<sub>1</sub> * t<sup>2</sup> / t<sub>1</sub> (d) m * v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> * t / t<sub>1</sub>

Q.2 A body is moved along a straight line by a machine delivering a constant power. The distance moved by the body in time ‘t’ is proportional to (a) t<sup>0.75</sup> (b) t<sup>1.5</sup> (c) t<sup>0.25</sup> (d) t<sup>0.5</sup>

Q.3 A 70 Kg man leaps vertically into the air from a crouching position. To take the leap the man pushes the ground with a constant force F to raise himself. The centre of gravity rises by 0.5 before he leaps. After the leap the C.G. rises by another 1m. The maximum power delivered by the muscles is: (Take g = 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>)

(a) 6.26 * 10<sup>3</sup> W at start (b) 6.26 * 10<sup>3</sup> W at take-off (c) 6.26 * 10<sup>4</sup> W at start (d)  6.26 * 10<sup>4</sup> W at take off

Q.4 Two bodies of equal masses are dropped on a planet from two different heights ‘a’ and ‘b’ above ground (a > b). The average power delivered by gravity to the two masses in the last second of motion are Pa and Pb, then (Assuming that both the masses travel for more than 1 second and neglecting air resistance):

(A) P<sub>a</sub> > P<sub>b</sub> 	(B) P<sub>b</sub> > P<sub>a</sub>	(C) P<sub>a</sub> = P<sub>b</sub> (D) None
